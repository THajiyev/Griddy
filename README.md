# Griddy

On September 27th, 2020, Justin Jefferson registered his first NFL touchdown. On his way to the end zone, he started to "hit the griddy".

The clips of this touchdown went viral, and the griddy became associated with Justin Jefferson. 
The GIF above remains popular in the football community, so I decided to display it in a new way.
In this project, you will see Justin Jefferson hitting the griddy, but instead of images or videos, it will use 100 lines of ASCII characters.

## How to use this code?

Step 1:

This program uses the library PyGame. It is not a standard library, so to install it, run the following command in your terminal.

```
pip install pygame
```

Step 2(optional):

Choose any song you want to play in the background and save it in the WAV format. Name it **griddy.wav** and put it in the directory of this project. 
The song that usually goes along with the griddy is [Right Foot Creep by YoungBoy Never Broke Again.](https://youtu.be/xyMdPAEjT-0)

Step 3:

Run the following command in the terminal.
  
```
python main.py
```
